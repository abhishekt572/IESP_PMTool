<h1 id="time-tracking">Time tracking</h1>

<p>Users can book their time or units spent on an activity within a project directly on work packages,  which gives a clear indication of how much effort the project activities require. You can either log time in the work package view or via a commit message.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**Note**: To use the time tracking functionality, the **Time and costs module** needs to be activated in the [project settings](../../projects/project-settings/modules/).

<p>In order to log spent hours for a certain activity, open the details of the corresponding work package.

<ol>
  <li>The date, for which the time will be logged.</li>
  <li>The actually logged time (in hours).</li>
  <li>The <strong>Activity</strong> drop down menu offers a choice of activity  categories, such as coordination or development. The range of categories can vary from project to project and can be edited by a project  administrator or a role with respective permissions.</li>
  <li>The comment field, where you can note a more detailed description of the activities that you log time for.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget to <strong>Save</strong> your logged time.</li>

<h2 id="logging-time-via-commit-message">Logging time via commit message</h2>

<p>Note: the “enable time logging” option must be activated under system settings in order to log time via a commit message.</p>

For  example refs #123 @2h will log 2 hours for the work package number 123.<img src="3-Log-time-via-commit-message.png" alt="3-Log-time-via-commit-message" /></p>

<h2 id="edit-logged-time">Edit logged time</h2>

<p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> icon next to a time entry in the list.</p>

<p><img src="image-20201005143256420.png" alt="image-20201005143256420" /></p>
