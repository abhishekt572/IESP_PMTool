<p>The following bugs have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When an action is performed on the work package split screen, the

were partly hidden

displayed when first logging into an OpenProject instance if no
language has been configured
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21119">#21119</a>).</li>
  <li>For users of OpenProject-CE packager installation on CentOS, a bug
has been fixed which affects a wrong autostart configuration

</ul>

<p>Additionally, new translations have been included (including complete
translations for Swedish).</p>
