<p>You can <strong>add participants</strong> (Invitees and Attendees) to a meeting while being in the <a href="#edit-a-meeting">edit mode</a>. The process is the same whether you are creating a new meeting or editing an existing one. Additionally you can record after the meeting who actually took part in it.</p>

<p>You can see the list of all the project members under <strong>Participants</strong>. This list varies from project to project. If you select the field in the columns Invitees or Attendees, the selected project members will be notified automatically when an agenda or a meeting protocol is created.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the toolbar you can make changes to the text format or edit macros, e.g. table of contents or work package tables (see the <a href="../wysiwyg">documentation for the WYSIWYG editor</a> for details).</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="copy-a-meeting-recurring-meetings">Copy a meeting (recurring meetings)</h2>

<p>If you have recurring meetings, such as a Jour Fixe, and want to simplify the process of creating meetings and agendas, you can <strong>copy an existing meeting</strong>. To do that select the meeting and open the detailed meeting view.</p>
