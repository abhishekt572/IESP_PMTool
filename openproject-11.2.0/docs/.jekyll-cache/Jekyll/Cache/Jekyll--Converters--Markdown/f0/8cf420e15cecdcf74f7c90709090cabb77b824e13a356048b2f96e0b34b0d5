<p>OpenProject 4.0.5 has been released which contains several bug fixes.<br />
We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations.</p>

<p>The following bugs have been fixed in the core:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When sorting by a version in the work package list, the result was
not shown but an unclear error message displayed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17928" title="Sorting by version leads to 500 in experimental API (\&quot;Unable to retrieve query from URL\">#17928</a> (closed)‚Äù)).</li>
  <li>Clicking on the project name in a timeline let to ‚ÄúPage not found‚Äù
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17819" title="[Regression] Page not found when clicking on project link in timeline (NaN in link) (closed)">#17819</a>).</li>
  <li>The ‚ÄúClose‚Äù icon of modals was cut off
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17818" title="[Regression] Close icon of modals is cut off (closed)">#17818</a>).</li>
  <li>Dates in the work package list were sometimes not displayed properly
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17043" title="Single bad translation on work package table. (closed)">#17043</a>).
Thanks a lot to <a href="https://community.openproject.org/users/35400">Mike
Lewis</a> for reporting
this error!</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the work package export via CSV is working properly again
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/16813" title="CSV Export is fixed (closed)">#16813</a>).
Before, only the default columns were displayed in the exported file.<br />
A big thanks goes to <a href="https://github.com/TribesTom">Thomas Tribolet</a> for
fixing this bug!</p>

<p>Finally, syntax highlighting is working again (e.g. in the wiki and
repository):</p>

<p>In the Translations plugin an error was fixed which caused translations
in the work package list not to be displayed properly
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17944" title="Missing js files added (closed)">#17944</a>).<br />
