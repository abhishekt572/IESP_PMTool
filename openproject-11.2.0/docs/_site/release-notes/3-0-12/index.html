<h1 id="openproject-3012">OpenProject 3.0.12</h1>

<p>With the release of version 3.0.12 several security threats in
OpenProject are fixed.<br />
These concern user permissions and the visibility of administration
settings for logged out users. We advise everybody to update their
OpenProject installation.</p>

<p>In addition, an error concerning the API v2 has been solved
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/6688" title="APIv2: ids-parameter ignored for planning_elements.json (closed)">#6688</a>)
and several usability bug fixes in the meetings and documents plugin are
included in 3.0.12:</p>

</ul>

<!-- end list -->
