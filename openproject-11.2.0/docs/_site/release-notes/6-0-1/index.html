<h1 id="openproject601">OpenProject 6.0.1</h1>

<p><strong>OpenProject 6.0.1 contains the following changes for the
<span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-8">Wiki</span>
module:</strong></p>

<p>In OpenProject versions prior to 6.0.0., specific characters of
<a href="../../user-guide/wiki/">wiki</a> titles were removed
upon saving – especially dots and spaces. Spaces were replaced with an
underscore, while other characters were removed.<br />
Still, linking to these pages was possible with either the original
title (e.g., ‘[[Title with spaces]]’), or the processed title (e.g.,
‘[[title_with_spaces]]’).<br />
Starting
with <a href="https://www.openproject.org/openproject-6-0-released/">OpenProject 6.0.0</a>, titles
were allowed to contain arbitrary characters and were linked to using
escaped links.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/20151/activity">#20151</a>).<br />
That change caused those links with spaces to wiki pages to break after
the migration to OpenProject 6.0.0, since they now linked to a new page
(with actual spaces in its title, since that was allowed now).</p>

<p>This bug was fixed in
<a href="https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23674">#23674</a> alongside
a more permanent change to how wiki titles are produced. Titles may
still contain arbitrary characters now, but are processed into a
permalink (URL slug) upon saving.<br />
This causes the identifiers of wiki pages with non-ascii characters to
be more visually pleasing and easier to link to. When upgrading to
OpenProject 6.0.1., permalinks for all your pages will be generated
automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Additionally, the following errors have been fixed in OpenProject
6.0.1:</strong></p>
