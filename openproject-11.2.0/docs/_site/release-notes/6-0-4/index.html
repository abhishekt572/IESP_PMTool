<ul>
  <li>The <em>+ New
<span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-45">Project</span></em>
button was displayed even to users who didn’t have the permission to
create new work packages
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23881/activity">#23881</a>).</li>
  <li><span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-7">Work

was changed in the work package list
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23879">#23879</a>).</li>

timezone was set

order
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23773/activity">#23773</a>).</li>
