<h2 id="openproject-1040">OpenProject 10.4.0</h2>

<p>We released OpenProject 10.4. The new release of the open source project management software contains a new time tracking widget for the My page which facilitates visualizing and logging time spent on your tasks. Additionally, cost reports can now be exported to Excel.</p>

<p>Cloud and Enterprise Edition users can now choose between the default OpenProject theme, a light theme and a dark theme. This provides a good starting point for further design customization.</p>

<p>Read below to get a detailed overview of what is new in OpenProject 10.4.</p>

<h3 id="spent-time-widget-on-my-page">Spent time widget on My page</h3>

<p>Tracking your own time is a lot easier with OpenProject 10.4. The release replaces the existing Spent time widget on your personal My page with a modern time tracking overview. You can now easily see your logged time in a comprehensive weekly calendar view.</p>

<p>The tasks you worked on are color-coded. Therefore, you see right away which tasks you spent the most time on in the current week. Viewing or changing your logged hours is also a lot easier - simply drag and drop the time block to the correct day to make a change.</p>

<p><img src="Spent-time_My-page.png" alt="My spent time widget My page" /></p>

<h3 id="export-cost-reports-to-excel">Export cost reports to Excel</h3>

<p>Having the ability to export cost reports was one of the most requested features. With OpenProject 10.4 you can just that. From your cost report set the appropriate filters and export it as an Excel document.</p>

<p>The Excel spreadsheet lists the tracked time, cost, as well as the different cost types. This makes it very easy to perform further computations or to forward the data to someone else, e.g. your accounting department.</p>

<p><img src="Export-cost-report-1536x1065.png" alt="Export cost reports" /></p>

<h3 id="light-and-dark-theme-for-openproject-premium-feature">Light and dark theme for OpenProject (Premium feature)</h3>

<p>Cloud and Enterprise Edition users can now easily customize the look and feel of their OpenProject environment by using a custom logo and adjusting the color theme. With OpenProject 10.4 this gets a lot easier - thanks to default themes. Simply choose between the OpenProject theme, the light theme and the dark theme.</p>

<p>These themes are optimized and fulfill accessibility requirements. You can further customize them by starting with one of the default themes and adjusting individual colors based on your needs.</p>

<p><img src="Default_theme-1536x1082.png" alt="Light and dark theme" /></p>

<h3 id="updated-menus-for-project-and-system-administration">Updated menus for project and system administration</h3>

<p>The menus in the project and system administration are updated with OpenProject 10.4. Wherever possible the tab navigation has been replaced with sub menus.</p>

<p>The other tabs menus have been updated to a modern layout. Additionally, the email settings have moved out into their own menu item in the system administration.</p>

<h3 id="manage-multiple-ifc-models-in-openproject">Manage multiple IFC models in OpenProject</h3>

<p>In OpenProject you can now manage multiple building models in IFC format in parallel. <strong>Browse through multiple models at the same time</strong> and selectively activate models such as architecture and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). Set “default” models to be displayed.</p>
