<h1 id="openproject-81">OpenProject 8.1</h1>

<p>OpenProject 8.1 includes several improvements: A new guided tour helps
new users with onboarding and graphs are shown in the roadmap.</p>

<p>For users of the <a href="https://www.openproject.org/hosting/">Cloud Edition</a>
or <a href="https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/">Enterprise
Edition</a> the
conditional formatting has been improved: It is now possible to
highlight work packages based on the type as well.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-tour-for-new-users">Onboarding tour for new users</h2>

<p>Thanks to a new onboarding tour, new users can easily get started
working with OpenProject.<br />
Users can choose between a tour covering traditional project management
and agile project
management.</p>

<h2 id="graphs-in-the-roadmap">Graphs in the roadmap</h2>

<p>On the roadmap page you can analyze the different versions and releases
based on several attributes (e.g. status, priority, assignee).<br />
These values are now displayed by a nice
graph.</p>

<h2 id="highlighting-based-on-type-enterprise-edition--cloud-edition">Highlighting based on type (Enterprise Edition / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>As an addition to the conditional formatting which was introduced with
OpenProject 8.0, it is possible to highlight work package rows based on
the work package type. This way you can for example highlight bugs and
errors in a list of tasks.<br />
Additionally, it is possible to control which attributes are highlighted
at the same
time.</p>
