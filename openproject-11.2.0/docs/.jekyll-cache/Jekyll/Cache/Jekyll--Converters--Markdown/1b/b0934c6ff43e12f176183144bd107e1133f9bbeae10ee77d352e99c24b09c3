<p>OpenProject 5.0.16 contains several bug
    fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-7">Work
package</span> links (via ## and ###) in emails sent when
watching forums were not displayed properly. This has been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22728/activity">#22728</a>).</li>
  <li>An error on the work package page has been fixed which caused
multiple work packages to be created when clicking the “Create”
button multiple times
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22735/activity">#22735</a>).</li>
  <li>The selected work package type when creating a new child work
package was not based on the type order displayed in the
administration. This has been adjusted
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22639/activity">#22639</a>).</li>
  <li>Due to an error the project list could not be accessed in the
accessibility mode. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The star icon in the project list showing which project the user is
a member in was missing. It has been added
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22692/activity">#22692</a>).</li>
  <li>In the cost report, the cells were not displayed properly when
applying a grouping in the report. This has been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22762/activity">#22762</a>).</li>
  <li>In the Task board the option to adjust the column width was only
shown when the burndown chart option was available. It has been
adjusted to always be displayed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22297/activity">#22297</a>).</li>
  <li>Several design issues have been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22805/activity">#22805</a>,

<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22669/activity">#22669</a>)
and several new icons have been added to the administration
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22063/activity">#22063</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, an error has been fixed which prevented the proper use to
the <a href="https://community.openproject.org/projects/task-connector">TaskConnector for MS
