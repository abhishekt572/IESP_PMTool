<h2 id="what-is-a-work-package">What is a work package?</h2>

<p>A work package in OpenProject can basically be everything you need to keep track off within your projects. It can be e.g. a task, a feature, a bug, a risk, a milestone or a project phase. These different kinds of work packages are called <strong>work package types</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-work-package">Create a new work package</h2>

<p>To get started, create a new work package in your project, <a href="#open-an-existing-project">open the project</a> with the project drop-down menu, navigate to the <strong>module work packages</strong> in the project menu.</p>

<p>Within the work packages module, click the green + Create button to create a new work package. In the drop down menu, choose which type of work package you want to create, e.g. a task or a milestone.</p>

<p><img src="create-work-package-1569611257373.png" alt="create-work-package" /></p>

<p>A split screen view is opened with the new work package form on the right and the list of already existing work packages on the left.</p>

<p>If there are not yet any work packages in the project, you will see a message that there are no work packages to be displayed in the list.</p>

<p>In the empty form on the right, you can enter all relevant information for this work package, e.g. the subject and a description, set an assignee, a due date or any other field. The fields you can populate are called <strong>work package attributes</strong>. Also, you can add attachments with copy &amp; paste or with drag and drop.</p>

<p>Click the green <strong>Save</strong> button to create the work package.</p>

<p>The work package will the be displayed in the list view:</p>

<h2 id="open-and-edit-a-work-package">Open and edit a work package</h2>

<p>To open and edit an existing work package from the list, select the work package in the list which you want to edit and click on the <strong>open details view</strong> icon in the work package list or on top of the list to open the split screen view. Other ways to open it would be to double-click on the work package or to click on the work package ID.</p>

<p><img src="open-details-view-work-packages.png" alt="open-details-view-work-packages" /></p>

<p>By clicking through the list on the left hand side you will see the details of each work package on the right in the split screen.</p>

<p>Click in any of the fields to <strong>update a work package</strong>, e.g. description. Click the checkmark at the bottom of the input field to save changes.</p>

<h2 id="activity-of-work-packages">Activity of work packages</h2>

<p>To keep informed about all changes to a work package, open the <strong>ACTIVITY</strong> tab in the details view.</p>

<p>Here you will see all changes which have been made to this work package.</p>

<p>You can also insert a comment at the end of the Activity list.</p>
