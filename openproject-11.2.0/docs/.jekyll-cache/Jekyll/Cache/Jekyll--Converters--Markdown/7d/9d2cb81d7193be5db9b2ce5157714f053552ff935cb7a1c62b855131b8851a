<p>OpenProject 4.0.7 has been released which contains important security
and bug fixes.</p>

<p>We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installation.</p>

<p>In the previous OpenProject version it was possible to see some work
package information without authorization. This error has been fixed
with OpenProject 4.0.7.</p>

<p>Additionally, several errors on the work package list have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deleted work package queries which have been added to the side menu
are now properly removed when the query is deleted
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/18591" title="#18591">#18591</a>).</li>
  <li>The ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button in the query list is now only displayed when
changes have been made
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/18592" title="#18592">#18592</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, a bug has been fixed which caused an internal error when
creating a new reporting
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/18593" title="#18593">#18593</a>)
and an error related to the grouping of timelines has been addressed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/18690" title="#18690">#18690</a>).</p>
