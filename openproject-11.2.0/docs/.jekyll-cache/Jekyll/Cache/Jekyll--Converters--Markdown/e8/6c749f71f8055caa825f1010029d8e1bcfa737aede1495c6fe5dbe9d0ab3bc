<h3 id="subject">Subject</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The subject of the feature request should be as concise and crisp as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Backlogs] Grey out status fields in task board which cannot be used by role</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The feature description should be concise and expressive.</li>
  <li>Mention the reason why the change is relevant. Describe the associated use case.</li>
  <li>Add acceptance criteria for clarification.</li>
  <li>Describe the current behavior if it is to be changed by the request.</li>
  <li>Using the following (user story) format, describe the intent behind a new feature request:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>AS an OpenProject user
I WANT to only show the allowed status fields as active for which a status transition is allowed based on the workflow
SO THAT I am clearly aware which status transitions are allowed before doing them.
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance criteria</h3>

<ul>
  <li>State and detail the requirements in the acceptance criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In the task board only show the status allowed for the role the user has in the project as active.
      <ul>
        <li>The status fields which are inactive should have e.g. a grey background to make clear that a user cannot use them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="current-behavior">Current behavior</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If the feature request is changing existing behavior, briefly explain the current behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, all status transitions set for a type are displayed as active (independent of the allowed status transitions defined by the workflow).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="wireframes--screenshots">Wireframes / Screenshots</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If the request is visual, it is helpful to add a short wireframe or a screenshot in which changes are highlighted.</li>
  <li>The wireframe or screenshot can be attached as a file and can be integrated in the description with the following syntax: ‚Äú!Name_of_screenshot.png!‚Äù (without quotation marks)
(Notice: Name_of_screenshot should be replaced with the respective name of the file. The file ending (here: .png) has to be adjusted to the appropriate file type of the screenshot.)</li>
</ul>
