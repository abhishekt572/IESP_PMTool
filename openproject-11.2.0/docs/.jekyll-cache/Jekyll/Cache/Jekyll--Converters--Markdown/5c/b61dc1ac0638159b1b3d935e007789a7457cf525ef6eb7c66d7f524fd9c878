<h2 id="what-is-a-gantt-chart">What is a Gantt chart?</h2>

<p>With Gantt charts in OpenProject you can create and manage a project plan and share the information with your team. You can schedule your tasks and visualize the required steps to complete your project. As a project manager you are directly informed about delays in your project and can act accordingly.</p>

<p>The dynamic Gantt chart in OpenProject displays the phases and milestones in your project as well as relationships between them. Each element in the timeline has both a start as well as a finish date so you are always informed about the current status.</p>

<h2 id="activate-the-gantt-chart-view">Activate the Gantt chart view</h2>

<p>To open the Gantt chart view in OpenProject, the <a href="../projects/#activate-and-deactivate-modules">work packages module needs to be activated</a> in the project settings.</p>

<p>Within your project menu, navigate to the work packages module. Select the <strong>Gantt chart view</strong> in the work package list with the button on the top right.</p>

<p><img src="Activate-Gantt-chart.png" alt="Activate-Gantt-chart" /></p>

<p>You can activate a Gantt chart view from any work package list (or saved query) by selecting the Gantt view from the top.</p>

<p>The Gantt chart then displays all work package types, e.g. phases and milestones, tasks or bugs, in a timeline view.</p>

<p>It shows dependencies between different work packages as well as additional information, e.g. subject, start or due dates.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-project-plan">Create a project plan</h2>

<p>To create a project plan in OpenProject, activate the work package module and select the <a href="#activate-the-gantt-chart-view">Gantt chart view</a>.</p>

<p>You can create new work packages directly in the list by clicking on the <strong>create new work package</strong> link at the bottom of the list. You can change the work package type or other attributes directly in the list view.</p>

<p>Click in the Gantt chart to add an element in the project plan.</p>

<p>You can change the duration or move the element in the project plan via drag and drop.</p>

<h2 id="edit-a-project-plan">Edit a project plan</h2>

<p>You can edit a project plan by clicking directly in the list and change work package attributes, e.g. Status, Priority or Assignee.</p>

<p>To change the start and end date or the duration of a work package, click directly in the Gantt chart and change it via drag and drop.
All changes will also be tracked in the work packages <a href="../../user-guide/activity">Activity</a>.</p>
