I"?<h1 id="manage-users">Manage users</h1>

<p>The user list provides an overview of all users in OpenProject. You can create new users, make changes to existing user accounts and block or delete users from the system.</p>

<div class="glossary">
**User** is defined as a person (described by an identifier) who uses OpenProject. Users can become project members by assigning them a role and adding them via the project settings.
</div>
<p>To manage users click on your avatar (top right corner) and select <em>Administration</em>. Select <em>Users &amp; Permissions -&gt; Users</em>. The list of current users is shown.</p>

<p>In the Community Edition there is no limit to the number of users. In Enterprise editions (cloud and on-premises) the user limit is based on your subscription. The number of users for your subscription is thus not bound to names. For example, if you block a user you can add a new one without upgrading.</p>

<h2 id="user-list">User list</h2>

<p>The User list is where users are managed. They can be added, edited or deleted from this list, which can be filtered if required.</p>

<p><img src="image-20200211141841492.png" alt="user list" /></p>

<p>Column headers can be clicked to toggle sort direction. Arrows indicate sort order, up for ascending (a-z/0-9) and down for descending (z-a/9-0). Paging controls are shown at the bottom of the list. You will also see whether a user is a system administrator in OpenProject.</p>

<h2 id="filter-users">Filter users</h2>

<p>At the top of the user list is a filter box. Filter by status or name, then click the blue <strong>Apply</strong> button to filter the list. Click the <strong>Clear</strong> button to reset the filter fields and refresh the list.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - select from Active, All or Locked Temporarily. Each selection shows the number of users.</li>
  <li><strong>Name</strong> - enter any text; this can contain a “%” wild card for 0 or more characters. The filter applies to user name, first name, last name and email address.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="image-20200115155456033.png" alt="filter users" /></p>

<h2 id="lock-and-unlock-users">Lock and unlock users</h2>

<p>Handling locking and unlocking of users is also done from the user list. To disable a user’s access click the <strong>Lock permanently</strong> link next to a user. Use the <strong>Unlock</strong> link to restore the user’s access.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="../../../cloud-edition-guide">Enterprise cloud</a> or <a href="../../../enterprise-edition-guide">Enterprise on-premises</a> locking a user will make a new user available to add to the system within your booked plan.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**Note**: The previous activities from a locked user will still be displayed in the system.
</div>

<p><img src="System-admin-guide_lock-users.png" alt="System-admin-guide_lock-users" /></p>

<p>If a user has repeated failed logins the user will be locked temporarily and a “Reset failed logins” link is shown in the user list. Click the link to unlock it now, or wait and it will be unlocked automatically. Have a look at the section <a href="../../authentication/authentication-settings/#other-authentication-settings">Other authentication settings</a> for failed attempts and time blocked.</p>

<h2 id="create-users">Create users</h2>

<p>New users can be created and configured by an administrator or by the users themselves (if activated).</p>

<h3 id="invite-user-as-administrator">Invite user (as administrator)</h3>

<p>In the user list, click the <strong>+User</strong> button to open the “New user” form.</p>

<p><img src="image-20200115155855409.png" alt="new user" /></p>

<p>Enter the email address, first name, and last name of the new user. Tick the box to make them a system administrator user.</p>

<p>Note: the email field must be a valid format and be unique or it will be rejected on clicking the button.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button to add the user and show that user’s details page. Click the <strong>Create and continue</strong> button to add the user and stay on the new user form to add another user. Either way, the new user will be invited via email.
When adding the last of multiple users you can click on <strong>Create</strong> or click the <strong>Users</strong> link in the menu on the left. The Users list is shown. Click each user in turn to <a href="#set-initial-details">edit their details</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-user-via-self-registration">Create user (via self-registration)</h3>

<p>To allow users to create their own user accounts allow self-registration in the <a href="../../authentication/authentication-settings">authentication settings</a>. A person can then create their own user from the home page by clicking on the “Sign in” button (top right), then on the “Create a new account” link in the sign in box.</p>

<p>Enter values in all fields (they cannot be left blank). The email field must be a valid email address that is not used in this system. Click the <strong>Create</strong> button. Depending on the <a href="../../authentication/authentication-settings">settings</a> the account is created but it could be that it still needs to be activated by an administrator.</p>

<h4 id="activate-users">Activate users</h4>

<p>Open the user list. If a user has created their own account (and it has not been activated automatically) it is shown in the user list with an “Activate” link on the right. Click this link and continue to add details to this user as below. There is also an “Activate” button at the top of the user’s details page.</p>

<h3 id="set-initial-details">Set initial details</h3>

<p>You can edit the details of a newly created user. Useful fields might be Username, Language and Time zone. You might also fill Projects, Groups and Rates, or leave these to the “Project creator”.
Also consider the <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> settings.</p>

<p>See <a href="#manage-user-settings">Manage user settings</a> for full details.</p>

<h3 id="resend-user-invitation-via-email">Resend user invitation via email</h3>

<p>If a user did not receive the email invitation or shall change their authentication method to email, you can send the invitation to the user again if needed. In the user list, click on the user name to whom you want to resend the email with the invitation link to the system.</p>

<p>In the top right, click the <strong>Send invitation</strong> button in order to send the email once again.</p>

<h3 id="delete-user-invitations">Delete user invitations</h3>
<p>To invalidate or revoke a user’s invitation click on the user name and then on <strong>Delete</strong> in the upper right corner. This will prevent the invited user from logging in.

<h2 id="manage-user-settings">Manage user settings</h2>

<p>You can manage individual user details if you click on the user name in the list. These settings will overwrite the individual user’s settings set in their My Account settings.</p>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<p>The available authentication methods affect the content of the Authentication section in the General tab of the user details.</p>

  <li>You can phone the new user or send them an email, not using OpenProject, to give them the password. In this case it is more important to tick the enforce password change tickbox.</li>
  <li>Tick the Assign random password, and probably the enforce password change tickbox. When the details are saved OpenProject will send an email to the new user with their password.</li>
