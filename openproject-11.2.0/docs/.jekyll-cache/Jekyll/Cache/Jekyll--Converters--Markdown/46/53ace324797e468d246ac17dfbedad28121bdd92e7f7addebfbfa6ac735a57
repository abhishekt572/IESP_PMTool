<p>The 3.0.13Â patch release for OpenProject contains several bug fixes.</p>

<p>In particular, an internal error occurring when adding two identically
named queries as menu entries to the project menu has been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/15447" title="Duplicate shared queries lead to internal server errors upon menu rendering (closed)">#15447</a>).</p>

<p>Displaying the work package details page in the previous version could
take quite long â€“ depending on the number of watchers on the OpenProject
instance. This has been fixed as well so that the work package details
page is displayed quickly again
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/15705" title="Details view slow (closed)">#15705</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, a bug in the API v2 has been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/15958" title="API v2: parent id not returned when using ids-filter (regression) (closed)">#15958</a>).</p>

<p>An error preventing to copy projects in OpenProject persists in 3.0.13
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/15706" title="[Copy project] Projects cannot be copied (formerly: Subprojects are not copied correctly and the ... (closed)">#15706</a>),
it will be addressed in the next patch release (3.0.14).</p>
