bug fixes included.</p>

<h2 id="features-4">Features (4)</h2>

(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25556/activity">#25556</a>).</li>

(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25318/activity">#25318</a>).</li>
  <li>As a user of the <a href="https://www.openproject.org/hosting/">Cloud

</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-20">Bug fixes (20)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Deactivated groupings on the work package page were not properly
saved in queries. This has been fixed.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25606/activity">#25606</a>)</li>
  <li>When grouping by assignee while the author is shown as a column, the
same groups were shown multiple times. This has been resolved.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25605/activity">#25605</a>)</li>
  <li>In some cases type-specific attributes were not shown for work
packages. This has been fixed.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25594/activity">#25594</a>)</li>
  <li>Deep links to a repository page redirected back to the root
repository page. This has been resolved.</li>
  <li>We fixed an error prevented users from scrolling the work package
query menu.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/telekom/work_packages/25572/activity">#25572</a>)</li>
  <li>When filtering for Boolean work package custom fields incorrect
results were shown. This has been resolved.</li>
  <li>Bulk deleting work packages which contain time entries caused an
error. This has been fixed.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25569/activity">#25569</a>)</li>
  <li>Long text work package custom fields were not shown in correct size
in work package fullscreen mode. This has been resolved.</li>
  <li>Categories with long names caused rows in the work package table to
span multiple lines. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Exported work package CSV files could not be opened properly if the
ID was displayed as the first column. This has been resolved.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25536/activity">#25536</a>)</li>
  <li>Search results for work package relations showed HTML attributes.
This has been fixed.
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25534/activity">#25534</a>)</li>
  <li>We fixed an error that caused work package attributes to sometimes
not be saved properly when editing in quick succession.</li>
  <li>There was an error that caused Boolean custom fields to always be
set to “True” after copying a work package – even when the value was
set to “False” in the original work package. This has been
fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-17">Timeline</span>
relationships between milestones and phases were sometimes not shown
correctly. This has been addressed.</li>
  <li>In some cases the hierarchy mode was only applied after clicking the
respective icon multiple times. This has been resolved.</li>
  <li>When saving an query that has been added to the side menu, the new
query was not shown as part of the side menu. We fixed this issue.</li>
  <li>Several design bugs have been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/25595/activity">#25595</a>,
