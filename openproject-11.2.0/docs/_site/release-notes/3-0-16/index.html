<h1 id="openproject-3016">OpenProject 3.0.16</h1>

<p>A new patch release for OpenProject 3 (3.0.16) has been released which
contains several security updates and bug fixes.<br />
We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations.</p>

<p>With OpenProject 3.0.16, the Rails version has been updated to 3.2.21
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17468" title="Updating Rails to 3.2.21 (closed)">#17468</a>).<br />
In addition, an older version of Net-LDAP has been upgraded which caused
problems in combination with Apache DS
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17498" title="Upgrade version of \&quot;Net-LDAP\&quot; (fixes problems with Apache DS) (closed)">#17498</a>).</p>

<p>In the previous OpenProject version the permission for “Spent time” was
not applied properly. This has been fixed with OpenProject 3.0.16
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17496" title="Permission for 'spent time' not applied on legacy WP view and list of time entries (closed)">#17496</a>).</p>

<p>A big thanks goes to everyone involved in fixing and reporting those
bugs!</p>
