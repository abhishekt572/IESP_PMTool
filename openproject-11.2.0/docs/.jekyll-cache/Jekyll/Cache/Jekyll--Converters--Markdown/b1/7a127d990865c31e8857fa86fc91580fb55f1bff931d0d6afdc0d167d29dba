<p>OpenProject 4.0.8 has been released which containsÂ a performance bug
fix.</p>

<p>We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installation.</p>

<p>In OpenProject 4.0.7 some projects reacted very slowly when the project
contained project members which had a lot of memberships. This error
occurred especially in OpenProject instances with a large number of
projects. Since this error significantly reduced the usability, it has
been fixed in OpenProject 4.0.8.
