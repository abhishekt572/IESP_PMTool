<p>You can click on “Select a project” on the upper left side and then choose “View all projects” to get an overview of all projects. You can also apply filters to filter e.g. by projects for which you are set as the responsible. If you want to see the individual work packages in the projects, you can click on the module icon (the icon with the 9 squares) in the upper right side and choose “Work packages” from the dropdown menu. This shows all work packages across all projects you have access to. You can then click on the “Project” column header and select “Group by” to group by project.
