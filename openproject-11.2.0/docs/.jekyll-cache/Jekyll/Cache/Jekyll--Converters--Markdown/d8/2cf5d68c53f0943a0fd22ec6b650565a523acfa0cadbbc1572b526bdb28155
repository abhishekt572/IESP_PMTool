<h1 id="openproject-1060">OpenProject 10.6.0</h1>

<p>The new release of the open source project management software brings improved table formatting, quicker time logging, the Slovenian translation, better overview over activities and  much more usability improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<h3 id="better-styling-of-tables-with-improved-table-formatting-options">Better styling of tables with improved table formatting options</h3>

<p>With the new release of OpenProject you can now customize your tables in the text editor even more. When integrating a table in a work  package description, a meeting, the wiki or news, format it the way you  want to. The new additional options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limiting of the table’s and cell’s width,</li>
  <li>choose a color for the grid and the cell’s background (HEX/XSL or standard color palette),</li>
  <li>padding in cells,</li>
  <li>alignment within the cell, and</li>
  <li>defining a CSS rule to break long words in cells.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quicker-time-logging-on-work-packages">Quicker time logging on work packages</h3>

<p>From now on, time logging is even  quicker. You won’t have to leave your current work environment to log  time. For example, directly in the work package you will find an icon to log time. When you click on it, you can log your time in a pop-up window.</p>

<p><img src="time-logging.png" alt="time-logging" /></p>

<p>Also, you can log time to a work package directly from your work  package list view if you include the SPENT TIME as a column to the list. Clicking on the Log time will also open a pop-up window to book your  spent time.</p>

<h3 id="support-of-slovenian-language">Support of Slovenian language</h3>

<p>We are very happy that OpenProject is now 100% translated into Slovenian.  Zabavaj se!</p>

<h3 id="attribution-of-cards-to-a-project">Attribution of cards to a project</h3>

<p>OpenProject 10.6 will upgrade the card view of work packages. To make clear what card belongs to what project, the project name will be shown on the card.</p>

<p><img src="card-view-subproject.png" alt="card-view-subproject" /></p>

<h3 id="improved-assignee-board-if-there-are-no-members-in-a-project">Improved assignee board if there are no members in a project</h3>

<p>If you are creating an agile boards by assignees, you will get  notified if there are no members in your project. You will also get  notified if you are trying to add another assignee list to your board  even though there is no more member left.</p>

<h3 id="various-usability-improvements-and-bug-fixes">Various usability improvements and bug fixes</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the <strong>styling of the news widget</strong> on the project overview page as well as the start page has been improved. Going forward, the <strong>Activity module is only showing one activity per minute</strong> per user per work package and type of change. That means the changes per minute are aggregated.</p>
