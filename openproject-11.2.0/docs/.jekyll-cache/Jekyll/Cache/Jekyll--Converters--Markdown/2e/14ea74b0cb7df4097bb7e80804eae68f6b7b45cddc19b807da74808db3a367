<h2 id="how-to-create-work-packages">How to create Work packages</h2>

<p>There are two ways to create new Work packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work packages can be <a href="#create-a-work-package-in-the-list-view">created in-line in the Work package list</a> (just like Excel) to quickly create multiple Work packages.</li>
  <li>Work packages can be <a href="#create-a work-package-in-the-split-screen-view">created in a split screen</a> which allows you to specify detailed information from the start.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work packages always belong to a project. Therefore, you first need to <a href="../../../getting-started/#open-an-existing-project">select a project</a>.</p>

<p>Then, navigate to the Work package module in the project navigation.</p>
