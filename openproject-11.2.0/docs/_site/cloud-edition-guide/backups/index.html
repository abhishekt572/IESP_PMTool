<h1 id="backups">Backups</h1>

<p>Your Enterprise cloud data is backed up continuously and retained for 30 days.
Within those 30 days we can restore your data to any point in time with a precision of 5 minutes, in case you need us to.</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>For the time being you cannot download backups yourself.
You will have to <a href="mailto:support@openproject.com">get in touch</a> with us.
We can then provide a current or past backup (database + attachments) to you.</p>

<p>This way you can also get your data if you decide to stop using the Enterprise cloud edition.</p>
