<p>OpenProject 7.0 is the biggest OpenProject release yet with amazing new
features: A new interactive timeline, hierarchies in the work package
list, multi-select custom fields and much more.</p>

<h2 id="new-integratedgantt-chart--timeline">New integratedÂ Gantt chart / timeline</h2>

<p>OpenProject 7.0 introduces a new Gantt chart which is integrated in the
work package list
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/13785/activity">#13785</a>).</p>

<p>The new timeline is much more interactive and user-friendly than the old
timeline.</p>

<h2 id="display-hierarchies-in-work-package-list">Display hierarchies in work package list</h2>

<p>You can displayÂ hierarchies on the work package list and collapse and
expand them
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/24647/activity">#24647</a>).</p>

<h2 id="attribute-group-configuration-for-work-package-types">Attribute group configuration for work package types</h2>

<p>With OpenProject 7.0 you can configure which attributes
areÂ displayedÂ for a work package type
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/24123/activity">#24123</a>).</p>

<p>You can therefore control which attributes are shown and which are
hidden by default.</p>

<h2 id="filter-based-on-date-in-work-package-list">Filter based on date in work package list</h2>

<p>The work package list now supports filtering based on fixed dates. This
affects all date attributes (e.g. start / due date, created on / updated
on)
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/telekom/work_packages/22585/activity">#22585</a>).</p>

<h2 id="new-header-navigation">New header navigation</h2>

<p>The header navigation in OpenProject is updated and displays the current
project. Additionally, the logo has been centered and existing menus
have been reordered
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/design/work_packages/24465/activity">#24465</a>).</p>

<h2 id="archive-and-delete-projects-from-project-settings">Archive and delete projects from project settings</h2>

<p>As an administrator you can archive and delete projects right from the
project settings
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/24913/activity">#24913</a>).</p>

<h2 id="zen-mode-on-work-package-page">Zen-mode on work package page</h2>

<p>With the zen mode on the work package list, you can maximize the
available screen real estate by hiding the side and top navigation
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/18216/activity">#18216</a>).</p>

<p>This provides a cleaner and larger user interface to work with.</p>

<h2 id="multi-select-custom-fields-enterprise--cloud-edition">Multi-select custom fields (Enterprise / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>Users of the OpenProject <a href="https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/">Enterprise
Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.openproject.org/hosting/">Cloud
Edition</a> can create multi-select
custom fields
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/24793/activity">#24793</a>).</p>

<p>With these custom fields you can select multiple values for work package
custom fields at once and also filter based onÂ them.</p>

<h2 id="logo-upload-and-custom-color-schemeenterprise--cloud-edition">Logo upload and custom color schemeÂ (Enterprise / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>Users of the OpenProject Enterprise Edition and Cloud Edition can upload
their own companyâ€™s logo instead of the OpenProject logo.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can change the colors by using a custom color scheme
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/gmbh/work_packages/18099/activity">#18099</a>,
<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/gmbh/work_packages/24460/activity">#24460</a>).</p>

improved. Loading and displaying work packages is faster.</p>
