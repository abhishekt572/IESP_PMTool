<p>Â </p>

<p>OpenProject 4.0.1 was released.<br />
The release fixes installation errors caused by an old version of
Sprockets and provides several important security fixes (including a
Rails update).<br />
We advise anyone to update their OpenProject installation.</p>

<p>Packager support for easier installation has been extended to also
include RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17165" title="Packaged based installer for RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu (closed)">#17165</a>).<br />
