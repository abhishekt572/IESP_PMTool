<h2 id="bug-assigned-to-filter-returns-work-packages-set-to-assignees-group">Bug: Assigned to filter returns work packages set to assignee’s group.</h2>

<p>When filtering by <em>Assigned to</em> with a single user selected, the filter
returns work packages assigned to that user. Since OpenProject 7.0,  it
also returns work packages assigned to any of the groups the user is a
member of. This is a side effect of a deliberate change made in 7.0.
Some customers depend on returning only the work packages assigned to
the single user. This bugfix release restores the original behavior.</p>

<p>If you want to filter for this exact behavior, a new filter named
<em><span class="pl-s"><span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-95">Assignee</span>
or belonging group</span></em> is now added that returns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>when filtering for a single user</strong>: Work packages assigned to this
user, and any group it belongs to</li>
  <li><strong>when filtering for a group</strong>: Work packages assigned to this
group, and any users within</li>
</ul>
