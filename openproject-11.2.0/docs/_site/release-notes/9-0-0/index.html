<h1 id="openproject-90">OpenProject 9.0</h1>

<p>OpenProject 9.0 introduces a board view to support agile project management with Kanban. In addition, you can define work package templates to rapidly create new work packages with a pre-defined structure. Each user can now add their own custom work package views to their my page.</p>

<p>Read below to get a detailed overview of what is new in OpenProject 9.</p>

<h2 id="board-view-enterprise--cloud-edition">Board view (Enterprise / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>The board view is a new module for OpenProject and allows Scrum and Kanban-style agile project mangement. You can display display a board view with the different statuses shown as columns (similarly to a Kanban board) and quickly update the status. Alternatively, you can define a basic board with custom names or display versions as columns (e.g. to plan your roadmap).</p>

<p>Since boards display work packages - just like the work packages list - you can easily combine traditional and agile project management. Simply schedule your tasks in the Gantt chart and work on them from the boards view.</p>

<p>To use boards you need to use either the Cloud Edition or the Enterprise Edition. If you currently use the Community Edition and would like to give boards a try, simply <a href="">request an Enterprise Edition trial license</a>.</p>

<h2 id="work-package-templates">Work package templates</h2>

<p>You can define templates for work package types. Templates are automatically displayed in the work package description when you create a new type (e.g. a bug) for which a template is defined. This makes it easier to quickly create new work packages with similar information while reducing errors.</p>

<p>Templates can be configured in the work package type configuration.</p>

<h2 id="work-package-widget-on-my-page">Work package widget on My Page</h2>

<p>On the My Page, each user can add work package widgets and customize which work packages to display.</p>

<p>You can filter and group by work package attributes and also display Gantt charts in the widgets.</p>

<h2 id="updated-work-package-list">Updated work package list</h2>

<p>Assignees are now directly displayed as avatars in the work package page. Additionally, the work package type selection has been updated.</p>

<h2 id="improved-usability">Improved usability</h2>

<p>OpenProject is even more user-friendly: You can add attachments (e.g. images) directly to meetings (agenda / minutes).</p>

<p>Creating work packages on the global work package list is now easier as well: When you select a type, only the projects in which the types are ativated can be selected in the project menu.</p>

<p>Filters and work package attributes are improved and support auto-completion.</p>
