<h1 id="openproject-420"><strong>OpenProject 4.2.0</strong></h1>

<h2 id="language-support-for-openproject-plugins"><strong>Language support for OpenProject plugins</strong></h2>

<p>OpenProject 4.2.0 includes language support for OpenProject core and
plugins
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/14922">#14922</a>) and
creates the foundation for a complete translation of OpenProject.</p>

<p>In total, more than 30 languages exist for OpenProject for which
translations can be added or changed via CrowdIn.</p>

<p>To help translate OpenProject in additional languages take a look at the
<a href="https://crowdin.com/projects/opf">OpenProject projects on CrowdIn</a>.</p>

<p>To request additional languages, please contact the project managers via
CrowdIn.</p>

<p>Users of the manual installation should remove the translations plugin
from their Gemfile.plugins since Translations are now provided by the
core (Gemfile).</p>

all work packages, viewing news and time entries) on the “View all
projects” page have been added to the “Modules” drop down menu for
easier and more intuitive access

name.</p>

administration navigation
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20503">#20503</a>).</p>
