<p>Due to data privacy reasons we automatically delete OpenProject trial environments a couple of weeks after they have expired.
If your OpenProject trial is not accessible through the known URL, it has likely been deleted.
You can easily <a href="https://start.openproject.com/">create a new OpenProject trial environment</a>. Simply enter your organization name (you can use the same name as before) and click on “Start Free Trial”.
In order to avoid that your data is getting deleted, please select a plan during your trial duration or shortly after your OpenProject trial environment has expired.</p>
