<h1 id="openproject-82">OpenProject 8.2</h1>

<p>OpenProject 8.2 includes several improvements, such as a modernized
calendar as well as many usability improvements.</p>

<p>Users of the <a href="https://www.openproject.org/hosting/">Cloud Edition</a> and
<a href="https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/">Enterprise Edition</a>
can change work packages to a read-only mode to avoid unwanted changes.
Additionally, embedded work package now also support relations.</p>

<h2 id="modernized-calendar-view">Modernized calendar view</h2>

<p>The existing calendar view has been replaced with a new, modern calendar
view with OpenProject 8.2. This affects all existing calendar views
(e.g. in a project, on the
<span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-57">My
page</span>).</p>

<h2 id="usability-improvements">Usability improvements</h2>

<p>OpenProject 8.2 includes many usability improvements which make
OpenProject easier and smoother to use. Some examples of usability
improvements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a version from the roadmap and backlog page.</li>
  <li>Change a work package parent directly from the breadcrumb.</li>
  <li>A “Related to” relation is created automatically when copying a work
package.</li>
  <li>The OpenProject search searches the current project and subprojects
by default.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="read-only-mode-for-work-packages-enterprise-edition--cloud-edition">Read-only mode for work packages (Enterprise Edition / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>Users of the Enterprise Edition and Cloud Edition can define read-only
work package statuses. When you change a work package’s status to a
read-only status, the work package can no longer be modified. This
allows you to avoid users to e.g. make changes to a work package once it
has been approved.</p>

packages" /></p>

<h2 id="embedded-work-packages-with-other-relation-types-enterprise-edition--cloud-edition">Embedded work packages with other relation types (Enterprise Edition / Cloud Edition)</h2>

<p>With OpenProject 8.2 the embed work package capability introduced with
OpenProject 8 is extended to be used with other relation types besides
hierarchical relationships.</p>

and delete time entries
(<a href="https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/29029/activity">#29029</a>),
