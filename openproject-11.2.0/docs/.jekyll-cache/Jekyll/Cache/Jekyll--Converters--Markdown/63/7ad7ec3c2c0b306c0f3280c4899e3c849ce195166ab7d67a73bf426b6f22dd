<p>The migration scripts that ran as part of the OpenProject 10.4.0 upgrade include an unfortunate bug that leads to some installations suffering data loss. Installations, that had time entry activities enabled/disabled per project, will have all their time entries assigned to a single time entry activity.</p>

<p>If you have updated to 10.4.0 and were using project-based time entry activities, please use the following guide to restore them:</p>
