<h1 id="openproject-1030">OpenProject 10.3.0</h1>

<p>The new release OpenProject 10.3 adds improved mobile support to OpenProject. Additionally, you can now use custom fields with right-to-left support for languages such as Arabic.</p>

<p>Read below to get a detailed overview of what is new in OpenProject 10.3.</p>

<h2 id="improved-mobile-support">Improved mobile support</h2>

<p>The work package view now displayes a tile view of your tasks when accessed on a mobile device.
This provides a clearer structure and overview. The most important information (such as subject, assignee and status) is visible right away.</p>

<p>Additionally, the header menu and device menu bar are hidden to provide as much screen space as possible.</p>

<h2 id="right-to-left-support-for-work-package-long-text-custom-fields">Right-to-left support for work package long text custom fields</h2>

<p>Work package custom fields of type “Long text” now optionally support text with a right-to-left orientation (such as Arabic).
You can use those custom fields to properly display text with a right-to-left orientation.</p>
