<h2 id="what-is-a-board">What is a Board?</h2>

<p>Agile Boards in OpenProject support teams in their agile project management methodology, e.g. Scrum or Kanban.</p>

<p>You can create as many flexible boards as you want with both lists and cards on it. A list usually represents a workflow, e.g. status or version of a work package. The cards are work packages, e.g. tasks, on this list.</p>
