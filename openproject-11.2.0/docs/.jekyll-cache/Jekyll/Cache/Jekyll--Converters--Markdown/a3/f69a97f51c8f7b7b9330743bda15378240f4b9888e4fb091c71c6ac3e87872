<p>Release date: 2021-03-09</p>

<p>We released <a href="https://community.openproject.com/versions/1461">OpenProject 11.2.0</a>.
This new release will bring many new features and bug fixes that will improve classical as well as agile project management.</p>

<h2 id="placeholder-users-premium-feature">Placeholder users (premium feature)</h2>

<p>A new concept of placeholder users has been introduced with 11.2. Within the <em>Administration</em> -&gt; <em>Users and permissions</em> you are now able to create placeholder users without an email address and without taking away any license seats.</p>

<p><img src="add-placeholder-users.png" alt="add-placeholder-users" /></p>

<p>These preliminary users can then be added to projects. You can plan  with these resources and already assign tasks to them. This is  especially helpful when setting up a project template. Later, you can  then replace the placeholder users with real users in a project.</p>

<p><img src="assign-placeholder-users.png" alt="assign-placeholder-users" /></p>

<p>In the upcoming release we will continue working on this concept,  i.e. creating a visual distinction between real users and placeholder  users.</p>

<h2 id="extended-filter-options-by-parent-and-id">Extended filter options by parent and ID</h2>

<p>The work package filters are extended by new work package  attributes. You are now able to also select the parent as a filter option either by entering the name or ID of the parent work package. This way you can easily see all direct related children of a work package.</p>

<p><img src="filter-parent.png" alt="filter-parent" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, you can filter the work package table by ID to include (or exclude) only these work packages in the list.</p>

<p><img src="Filter-ID.png" alt="Filter-ID" />
 For example, choose those work packages you want to discuss in a meeting or that needs to be displayed on the project overview by filtering for exactly these IDs.</p>

<h2 id="distribution-of-user-administration">Distribution of user administration</h2>

<p>The user administration is now distributed to non-admins by a new  global role for more fine-grained user management. This way it is possible for non-admins to manage and invite users without having full admin privileges.</p>

<h2 id="ui-and-ux-improvements-and-various-bug-fixes">UI and UX improvements and various bug fixes</h2>

<p>Furthermore, with 11.2 we have implemented various UI and UX  improvements for OpenProject. We harmonized the navigation for the time and costs module so that it is consistent with the other navigation.  Also, we adapted the background colors of sum rows and group rows in the work package list so that it is easier to understand. We introduced a group show page (similar to the users show page) in order to link this page in case of mentioning a group and be also available for non-admins.</p>
