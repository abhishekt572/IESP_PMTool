  <li>Set the <strong>task type</strong>. The task type will appear in the task board to manage in your daily stand ups.
Please note: You canâ€™t use a work package type as story type <em>and</em> as task type.</li>

  <li>Set a template for <strong>sprint wiki page</strong>. If you create a wiki page with this name, e.g. sprintwiki, you will set up a new wiki page based on this template if you open it via the sprint drop-down menu in the backlogs view. This way, you can easily create templates for sprint review meetings or retrospectives.</li>
