<p>Additionally, some other translation related errors have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the admin area several languages were wrongly displayed as
“English”
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20801">#20801</a>).</li>
  <li>Some translations in the work package context menu broke the layout
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20835">#20835</a>).</li>
</ul>
