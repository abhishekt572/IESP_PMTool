<h3 id="how-do-i-prepare-a-budget-in-iesp-pm-tool">How do I prepare a budget in IESP PM TOOL?</h3>

<p>Budgets are currently limited to a single project. They cannot be shared across multiple projects.
This means that you would have to set up a separate budget for the different main and sub projects.
You can however use cost reports to analyze the time (and cost) spent across multiple projects. For details, you can take a look at our <a href="../time-and-costs/reporting/">time and cost reports user guide</a>.</p>
