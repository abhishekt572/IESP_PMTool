<h2 id="view-members">View members</h2>

<p>To view the list of <strong>all project members and their roles</strong> in the project, select Members in the project menu.</p>

<p><img src="image-20210305192605943.png" alt="project-member-list" /></p>

<h2 id="add-existing-users">Add existing users</h2>

<p>To add existing users, <a href="../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/placeholder-users">placeholder users</a> or groups to a project, <a href="../projects/#select-a-project">select the project</a> for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the <strong>Members</strong> module.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#view-members">members list</a> you will get an overview of the current members of this project.</p>

<p>Click the green <strong>+ Member</strong> button in the top right corner.</p>

<p>Type the name of the user, placeholder user or group which you want to add. You can also choose several members at once. <strong>Assign a role</strong> to the new member(s) and click the blue <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>

<p>Please note that you will have to click on the new member‚Äôs name or press the Enter key before clicking the Add button.</p>

<h2 id="invite-new-members">Invite new members</h2>

<p>You can also invite users who do not have an OpenProject account, yet. <a href="../projects/#select-a-project">Select the project</a> for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the <strong>Members</strong> module.</p>

<p>Type in the email address of the new member. If OpenProject does not find an existing user, the <strong>Invite</strong> information will automatically be put before the email address. Press the Enter key or select the text ‚ÄúInvite ‚Ä¶‚Äù. Assign a role to this new member and click the blue <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>

<p>An email invitation will be sent out to the user with a link to <a href="../sign-in-registration/#create-a-new-account">create an account</a> for OpenProject.</p>

<p><img src="1566224961670.png" alt="invite-new-members" /></p>

<p>You can now collaborate with your team in OpenProject. Newly invited users will be shown with a letter symbol next to their name.</p>

<p>Please note that removing a member who has not accepted the invite yet from a project will lead to the deletion of this user, which can‚Äôt be reversed.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-of-groups-as-project-members">Behavior of groups as project members</h2>

<p>Groups have the following impact on a project members list and behave slightly different than individual users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the group is shown as a separate line on the project members list</li>
  <li>the group members cannot be removed from the members list individually (no delete icon)</li>
  <li>adding a group with members who are already in a project member list will add the group‚Äôs role to their (the members‚Äô) project roles</li>
  <li>a project member belonging to a group can have additional roles added individually</li>
  <li>the group‚Äôs role cannot be changed for individual group members</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more about the management of groups <a href="../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/groups/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-of-placeholder-users-as-project-members">Behavior of placeholder users as project members</h2>

<p>Placeholder users have the following impact on a project members list and behave slightly different than regular users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>will be shown without email address</li>
  <li>can‚Äôt be part of a group</li>
</ul>
