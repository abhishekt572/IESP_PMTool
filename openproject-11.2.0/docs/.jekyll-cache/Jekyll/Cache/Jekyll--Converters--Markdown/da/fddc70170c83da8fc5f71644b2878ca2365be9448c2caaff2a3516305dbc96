<h2 id="roles-and-permissions">Roles and permissions</h2>

<p>Members will have different roles with different permissions in a project. To find out how to configure roles and permissions click <a href="../../system-admin-guide/#roles-permissions">here</a>.</p>

<div class="glossary">A **role** is defined as a set of permissions defined by a unique name. Project members are assigned to a project by specifying a user's, group's or placeholder user's name and the role(s) they should assume in the project.
</div>

<p>To assign work packages to a project member, the respective userâ€™s or placeholder userâ€™s role needs to be able to be assigned work packages. This is the default setting for default roles. You can check this setting in the <a href="../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions/#create-a-new-role">Roles and Permissions section</a> of the system administration.</p>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>

<p>Users can be added to groups. A group can be added to a project. With this, all users within a group will have the corresponding role in this project. Find out how to create and manage groups in IESP PM TOOL <a href="../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/groups">here</a>.</p>
