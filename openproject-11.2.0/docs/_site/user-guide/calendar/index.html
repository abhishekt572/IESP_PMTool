<h2 id="calendar-overview">Calendar overview</h2>

<p>To display the calendar in a project, the module <strong>Calendar</strong> needs to be activated in the <a href="../projects/#activate-modules">project settings</a>.</p>

<p>When you open the calendar, all work packages within the current project are displayed on the calendar, displaying the title of the work package. The colors represent the different <a href="../../system-admin-guide/#work-package-types">work package types</a>.</p>

<p>The current month is automatically selected. You can change the  date range between month or week and navigate through the views with the arrows on the left. The <strong>today</strong> button brings you back to the current date.</p>

<p>Hovering over one item displays more information to a work package, such as the type, status, start and finish date, assignee and priority, as well as the project to which the work package belongs.</p>

<p>Click on one item to open the work package details or to edit an item.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq">Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3 id="what-information-can-be-displayed-in-the-calendar">What information can be displayed in the calendar?</h3>

<p>The calendar automatically displays the start and end dates of work  packages in the current project. Additionally, the start and end dates of versions are shown in the calendar.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-embed--activate-the-calendar">Where can I embed / activate the calendar?</h3>

<p>To use the calendar in a project, you need to <a href="..//projects/project-settings/modules/#enable-modules-in-a-project">activate the “Calendar” module in the project settings</a>. Afterwards you can access the calendar in the project menu, as well as add it in the <a href="../project-overview/#add-a-widget-to-the-project-overview">project overview</a>. You can also enable the calendar in your <a href="../../getting-started/my-page/#add-widgets">“My page” view</a>.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-an-option-to-export-or-sync-the-calendar">Is there an option to export or sync the calendar?</h3>

<p>It is currently not possible to export or sync the calendar. You can however <a href="#meetings">export meetings as iCalendar file</a> and import them to your external calendar. If you would like Microsoft Outlook to automatically import calendar invites, please check your Outlook settings and make sure to give permission from that side.</p>

<h3 id="are-holidays-considered-in-the-calendar">Are holidays considered in the calendar?</h3>

<p>Currently, the calendar does not consider weekends or holidays as non-working days, i.e. the end date for a task could e.g. be set on a Sunday. This is important for businesses that are working on weekends or holidays. Please note that we are currently working on a feature for holidays and weekends that can be adjusted as needed.</p>
