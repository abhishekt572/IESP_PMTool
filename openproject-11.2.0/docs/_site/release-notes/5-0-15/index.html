<p>OpenProject 5.0.15 contains several bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date on the project activity was based on UTC+0 and therefore
showed the wrong date when being in a different time zone
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22641/activity">#22641</a>).</li>
  <li>When selecting a query and updating several work packages at once
using bulk edit, the focus was lost to the work package page. It now
remains on the query
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22330/activity">#22330</a>).</li>
  <li>Due to an error the search text for queries in the dark theme was
not visible. This has been fixed
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22654">#22654</a>).</li>
  <li>Several design improvements have been
made (<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21338/activity">#21338</a>,
<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21794/activity">#21794</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the accessibility has been improved
(<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21910/activity">#21910</a>,
<a href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22005/activity">#22005</a>).</p>
