<div class="glossary">
A **Group** is defined as a list of users which can be assigned to a project with a selected role. New groups can be defined in *Administration -&gt; Users &amp; Permissions -&gt; Groups*.
</div>

<p>OpenProject allows creating tailored project member <strong>groups</strong>, which  grant additional permissions to individual users within a project. Instead of adding individual users to a project you can add a user group, e.g. Marketing. You can edit existing groups, create new ones, add and remove users or delete groups.</p>

<h2 id="add-a-new-group">Add a new group</h2>

<p>After selecting <strong>Groups</strong> from the administration menu a list of the existing groups is shown, or a prompt to create a group if none exist.</p>

<p>Click the green <strong>+ Group</strong> button to create a new group.</p>

<p><img src="image-20200115164118182.png" alt="no existing groups" /></p>

<p>Give a name for your new group, which must be unique, and click the blue <strong>Create</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="image-20200115164328352.png" alt="new group" /></p>

<h2 id="add-users-to-a-group-edit-or-remove-groups">Add users to a group, edit or remove groups</h2>

<p>You can add users to a group and edit a group by clicking on the <strong>name of the group</strong> (1) and  delete the group by clicking on <strong>delete</strong> icon in the respective line (2).</p>

<p>After clicking on a group’s name, you can <strong>change the group name</strong>, <strong>add or remove group members</strong> and <strong>assign groups to projects</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="image-20200115164847858.png" alt="edit groups" /></p>

<h3 id="add-users-to-a-group">Add users to a group</h3>

<p>Click the <strong>Users</strong> tab. Select the users you want to add to this group from the “New user” drop-down list. Click the blue <strong>Add</strong> button. Users already in the group are not shown in the list. Click the “X” next to a user to remove that user from the group.</p>

<p><img src="image-20210302095755016.png" alt="add-users-to-group" /></p>

<p>Adding a user to a group also adds that user to the member list of <em>all</em> projects in which this group was assigned a <a href="../roles-permissions">role</a> (e.g. Member).</p>

<p>Removing a user from a group removes the role from that user in any project using that group. If the user has no other roles (i.e. who were only added as a member of this group and not individually) they are removed from the respective project completely.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-group-to-projects">Add a group to projects</h3>

<p>Click the <strong>Projects</strong> tab. Select the projects you want to add this group to from the “New project” drop-down list. Tick the roles that you want the group to have. Click the blue <strong>Add</strong> button. Users in the group are added to that project’s members using the role selected.</p>

<h2 id="delete-a-group">Delete a group</h2>

<p>To delete a group click on the <strong>delete</strong> icon in the respective line of the group list.</p>

<p>Deleting a group removes the role from the members of any project using that group. If any user has no other roles (i.e. who were only added as a member of this group and not individually) are removed from the respective project completely.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-groups-on-project-members">Impact of groups on project members</h2>

<p>Groups impact <a href="../../../getting-started/invite-members">project members lists</a> and <a href="../users">user details</a>. Changes in groups, project members or users may affect the other two.</p>

<p>Find out more about the behavior of groups as project members from a project admin’s perspective <a href="../../../getting-started/invite-members/#behavior-of-groups-as-project-members">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="group-profile">Group profile</h2>

<p>Similar to users, groups have a profile page which shows their name and members. Each member of a group is only visible for users with the necessary permissions (e.g. user has permission to see this member in a common project or user is system administrator).</p>

<p><img src="image-20210302144820982.png" alt="group-profile-page" /></p>

<p>The profile page can be accessed via the group’s <a href="/#add-users-to-a-group-edit-or-remove-groups">settings page</a>, via the overview page of projects the group is a member of and via <a href="../../../user-guide/work-packages/edit-work-package/#-notification">mentions</a> of the group.</p>
