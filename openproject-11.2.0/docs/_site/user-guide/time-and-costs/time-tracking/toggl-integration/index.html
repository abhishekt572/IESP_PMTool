<h1 id="time-tracking-with-toggl">Time tracking with Toggl</h1>

<p>To track time to a work package via a start and stop button, we offer an integration for the time recording software (or online timesheet software) Toggl (https://toggl.com/).</p>

<h2 id="openproject-toggl-integration">OpenProject Toggl integration</h2>

<p>You can install a browser add-in to track time via Toggl in OpenProject. This way, you can record spent times directly to a work package in OpenProject via a start/stop button.</p>

<p>If this is add-in is installed, a start/stop button is displayed on the work package details view, which can be used to record times from OpenProject into Toggl:</p>

<p>This integration can be added for example for Google Chrome as Chrome Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-button-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn.</p>

<p>You can then transfer the recorded times from Toggl to OpenProject via the API if needed.
Details can be found in our <a href="../../../../api/">API documentation</a>.</p>
